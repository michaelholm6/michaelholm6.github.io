  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto">I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student at Purdue University, studying dynamic system identification through machine learning using neural operators.
    Specifically, I'm currently investigating effective ways to make the Laplace Neural Operator <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10528" target="_blank">[1]</a> robust to noise
    and sparse data measurement. I'm also interested in investigating the effects of hydrogen isotope irradiation on tungsten in fusion reactors, and how machine vision and neural operators
    can be used to predict this behavior.
  </p>

    I also work at Sandia National Labaratories as an R&D intern. I work there part time during the school year, and have spent the past two summers in New Mexico working there full time.
    While working there, I have gotten additional experience in machine learning, neural networks, and data analysis.
  </p>

  <p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto">
    In my free time, I enjoy running, lifting, astrophotography, playing the piano, and hiking. I'm currently planning a backpacking trip to Yellowstone National Park, and have
    hiked in the Grand Canyon, many different national forests, along the Appalachian Trail, and in the Rocky Mountains.
