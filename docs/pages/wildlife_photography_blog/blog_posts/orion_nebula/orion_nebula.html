      <p>
        I recently had the opportunity to capture the Orion Nebula using my mirrorless micro 4/3 camera and my star tracker. 
        This image was created by taking 100 30 second exposures, and stacking them using DeepSkyStacker. The focal length was
        300mm full-frame equivalent. 
      </p>

      <h2>Equipment Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Camera: Olympus OM-D EM1 MK3</li>
        <li>Star Tracker: iOptron Skyguider Pro</li>
        <li>Stacking Software: DeepSkyStacker</li>
        <li>Post-Processing Software: Gimp</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges and Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        I had to make several attempts at creating this image, over several nights. The biggest challenge I had was making sure the background
        stars were in absolutely perfect focus. This is necessary because DeepSkyStacker is pretty bad at dealing with stars that are even 
        slightly out of focus. I also had to set up my sky tracker in such a way so as to mitigate the effects of wind moving the camera around.
        
        I learned that refocusing your camera throughout the night is necessary, because the temperature changes through the night can cause
        the focus to shift. This is caused by the lens elements expanding and contracting due to the temperature changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Image</h2>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This was my first truly successful astrophotography attempt, and it makes me so excited to see what I'll be able to capture in the future.
