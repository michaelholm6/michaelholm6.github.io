      <p>
        Throughout my time living in Iowa and Indiana, I've been fortunate enough to witness the Northern Lights on several occasions.
        Every time I see them, I'm amazed by their beauty and the sense of wonder they make me feel for the earth we live on.
        I imagine being an ancient human, looking up at those lights and imagining the sprits and concepts they might represent.
        When you see things like this in the world around you, it's easy to understand how so many beliefs, stories, myths, and 
        traditions were built around these natural phenomena, and how it resulted in such a wide variety of
        cultures around the world. Watching the lights dance in the sky, and feeling the same sense of wonder that I know
        those humans must have felt centuries ago makes me feel connected to something much larger than myself, and it's a feeling
        that's difficult to put into words.

        If you ever get the chance to see the Northern Lights in person, I highly recommend it.
        It's an experience you won't forget.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        I hope these aren't the last images I get to take of the Northern Lights. Right now, the sun is at near it's 
        peak of its 11 year cycle, so the chances of seeing the lights are higher than usual. As the years go on and
        the sun goes into its quieter phase, I worry that I won't get to see them as often. But whenever I do get
        the chance to see them again, I'll stay up irresponsibly late, drive far out of town, and set up my tripod
        to get more pictures. Thanks for reading!
