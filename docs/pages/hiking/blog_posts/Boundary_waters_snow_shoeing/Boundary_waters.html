      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        From December 2022 to January 2023, I went on a snowshoeing trip in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) in northern
        Minnesota. Specifically, I went to Superior National Forest. This was a solo trip, because I couldn't find anyone crazy enough to
        go hike around northern Minnesota in the dead of winter with me 😅. I hiked a total of 3 days, spending 2 nights camping, and used
        the nearby town of Ely, MN as a bit of a base camp to work from. This trip was the second time I had tried something like this,
        as the year before I had gone on a similar trip in the BWCAW, with the same intentions, but ended up abandoning that trip
        before the first night because my tent was not suitable for winter camping, and I also had serious trouble following any sort
        of trail in the snow. 
      </p>
      <p>

        This trip went much better, as I had a proper 4-season tent, and I also decided to instead hike on frozen lakes, which made 
        following trails unnecessary. Specifically, I snowshoed around Hegman Lake and Angleworm Lake.
        Overall, this trip was a great experience, and I learned a lot about winter camping and snowshoeing.
        I also learned how to safely snowshoe on frozen lakes, watching for areas of wet snow, and I learned how to self arrest 
        in case I fell through the ice (luckily I didn't need to test this skill). It was a great feeling to have the second attempt
        at this trip be so successful, and I hope I get the time (and motivation, if I'm being honest) to do a trip like this again.

      </p>

      <h2>Weather</h2>
      <p>
        The weather was classic northern Minnesota winter weather. During the day, temperatures were generally in the mid teens (°F), 
        while at night temperatures dropped to below -20. The nights got pretty windy, which made me happy to have my 4-season tent,
        but I didn't have any issues with the cold because, as you'll see in my packing list, I had some pretty great cold weather gear.
        There was also some pretty snowfall, but nothing too extreme. Overall, the weather was pretty great for a snowshoeing trip, and really
        made me appreciate the beauty of winter in northern Minnesota.
      </p>

      <h2>Highlights</h2>
      <p>
        Because this was a shorter trip, there weren't as many highlights to remember, but there were still a few standout moments. The first
        was seeing the Hegman Lake pictographs. These are ancient Native American rock paintings that are located on a cliff
        overlooking Hegman Lake. Seeing these pictographs in person was a really cool experience, and it was amazing to think about how
        old they are. It was also fun imagining how the Native Americans who created them got them drawn there. Did they walk over the frozen lake
        like I was doing? Or did they canoe there in the summer?
      </p>
      <p>
        My second highlight was the first night camping, when it dropped to about -20°F. I was a bit worried about how cold it would be, but
        I was pleasantly surprised by how well my gear kept me warm. In fact, I slept with very little clothing on, with my sleeping bag unzipped,
        and was still warm. My sleeping pad and bag are rated for much colder temperatures (around -40°F), but I was still surprised
        by just how warm I was. Additionally, hearing the wind howl outside, knowing my tent was literally maybe a foot above a lake of
        ice cold water was a pretty cool feeling. I wonder if any fish swam under my tent that night?
      </p>
      <p>
        My third highlight was my second night of camping. This night I was much further from any civilization, and I had an entire frozen lake
        to myself. Knowing that I was miles from the nearest person, in the dead of winter, was an experience I know not many people
        will ever get to have. And then, out of nowhere, a pack of wolves started howling very close to me, in the nearby surrounding forest. 
        They howled for maybe 15 minutes, and I sat out on the lake on my bear canister and just listened. It was an experience I'd almost call 
        spiritual, if it didn't sound so woo-woo. But it was definitely a feeling I'll remember for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I don't know if highlight is the best term for this, but my second route I snowshoed, out to Angleworm Lake, was some of the hardest
        hiking I've ever done. Angleworm Lake was a roughly 3 mile hike from the road, and about 2.5 of the miles were in completely untouched snow, in
        which I was sinking up to my knees WITH my snowshoes on. Just to test it, at one point I took one snowshoe off, took a step,
        and I fell down to about my waist in snow. Snowshoeing 2.5 miles in that, with a 40 pound pack on my back, was something to remember.
      </p>

      <h2>My routes</h2>
      <p>
        Shown below is a map of the routes I hiked through the national forest. I hiked two entirely separate routes,
        sleeping in Ely for a night in between the two routes.

      Additionally, here is an elevation profile of the first route. Obviously the majority of the elevation map should be flat, because I was hiking
      on a frozen lake, but there are slight inaccuracies with my GPS map, so oh well.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
       For this trip, I did two shorter snowshoeing routes out to two different lakes in Superior National Forest, camping overnight both nights.
       Overall, this trip was a great experience, and I learned a lot about winter camping and snowshoeing. It felt so good to have a successful
       second attempt at this trip. It showed me that I was learning from my past mistakes, and that I could push myself to do hard things. I also
       felt so lucky to get to experience wolves howling so close to me in the wilderness. I hope I can experience that again one day.
