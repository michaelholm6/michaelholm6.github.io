      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
          I recently went on a 5 day, 4 night backpacking trip through Yellowstone National Park with a group of friends. We hiked a total of about
          50 miles. We started at the northwest corner of the park, and went in a loop. We hiked through the Gallatin area of the park, which is
          one of the main areas of bear activity. Unfortunately, we didn't see any bears, but we did see some other wildlife, including elk and deer.
          The trip was the hardest backpacking trip I've done so far, due to really intense elevation changes. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Throughout the trip, we hiked up and over two mountain passes, summited a different mountain (Electric Peak, the second tallest in Yellowstone),
          and had a total elevation gain of about 10,000 feet. Being from the midwest, the high elevation hiking was definitely a challenge. Additionally, on our first
          day of hiking, one of the group members got food poisoning from some bad cheese, and had a VERY upset stomach. We seriously consisdered
          turning around and going back to the car, but ended up deciding to continue on. This thankfully turned out to be a good decision, as that group member
          ended up being mostly recovered by the end of the following day. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Our campsites were all great, and our milages came out to 11 miles the first day, then 8 miles, then 7 miles (up and down Electric Peak), 
          then 7 miles, then 16 miles(!) back to the car. That 16 mile day was very diffictult, as it again required going up and over
          a mountain pass, but we were all very motivated to get back to the car. My feet looked like marshmallows for about 2 days after
          that hike, but it was worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in organizing your own hike in Yellowstone, go to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/backcountry-permit.htm">this link</a> for information on how to get a backcountry permit.
      </p>

      <h2>Weather</h2>
      <p>
        The weather was great for most of our hike, and considering that it was the middle of summer, we got lucky. There was very little rain, but it wasn't intensely
        dry or hot. The temperature rarely got above 75 degrees, and at night it was usually in the 40s or 50s. There was a nice breeze during the days
        that kept bugs mostly away, however when we got in the trees, the mosquitoes were pretty bad. Additionally, up on the high mountain passes, 
        the wind was insane, and I genuinely thought I was going to be blown off the mountain a couple times. There was still a bit of snow at
        the really high elevations (10,000 feet and above), but it wasn't bad. We had considered bringing microspikes for potential ice, but 
        ended up deciding against it, and didn't need them in the end.
      </p>

      <h2>Highlights</h2>
      <p>
        We had a couple of pretty great highlights on this trip. The first highlight was reaching our camp the first night. Our first day was pretty
        difficult with the food poisoning case, and setting all our stuff down at that campsite for the first time was such a relief. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The second highlight was getting to the top of the first mountain pass. This was a really tough climb, especially with the food poisoning case,
        and the entire hike up, we were not sure if we were actually going to make it. For the last (approximately) 500 feet of elevation gain, we were
        either crawling on all fours with our 50 pound packs, or just taking 3-4 steps at a time then resting for 30 seconds, due to how steep and
        high elevation it was. But we made it to the top, and the view was absolutely incredible. We could see for miles in every direction, and 
        we saw a big herd of elk on the other side of the ridge. Then we stopped to eat lunch behind some brush so we could get out of the wind.
        It was a pretty rewarding spot to eat lunch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third was summiting Electric Peak. This was a day trip we did on our third day, and it was one of the hardest days of hiking I've ever
        done. We had our packs packed for a day hike, but they were still around 15-20 pounds with all the food, water, and photography gear I brought.
        The hike up was really steep, and there was a lot of loose rock. We had to stop a lot, and several times I considered turning around. There 
        were points where we were needing to rock climb up and down the mountainside, with our packs on, and below us was a sheer drop off. At one 
        point, one of the guys in our group commented that it was one of the most dangerous things he'd done in a long time. But it was fun! 
        And the view made it worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we crossed paths with a group badass of 60 year old women that summited the mountain about 15 minutes before us, and that really put me in my place :).
        However they were very impressed that we were all from the midwest and doing that hike, so that made up for it a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fourth was just the general experience of being at camp at night. Every night except for one we had a campfire, and we'd all spend 2 or 3 hours
        around the fire, reading, playing games, and just talking. The two other guys on the trip with me are very good friends of mine, so it was nice
        to be able to catch up with them about life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it's kind of weird to call this a highlight, but the last day of hiking, with 16 miles, felt so good to complete. Knowing that we had 
        covered a not insignificant part of Yellowstone in a single day, on foot, was pretty cool to think about. It was also a pretty fun bonding
        experience with the other two guys, because we were all going through hell together hiking those last 2 or 3 miles. And of course, it started
        raining right at the last few miles, so we got to stop and put on all our rain gear. But reaching the car just felt so good.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This hike was the hardest backpacking trip I've done so far. The path was just so steep at some points I felt like the only way to keep going forward was to literally
        crawl. Plus, the food poisoning case made the first day especially difficult. But even so, the trip was so fun, and I was sad to be done after only about an hour
        in the car driving home. I had two really great guys to hike with, and we all got along really well. This was the second backpacking trip I've organized to a 
        national park, and I feel like I'm really starting to learn how to navigate all the rules and logistics of backpacking in national parks.
